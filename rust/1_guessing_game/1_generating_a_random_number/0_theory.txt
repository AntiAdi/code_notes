Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard library.
However, the Rust team does provide a randcrate at https://crates.io/crates/rand/.

Crate : A package of Rust code. 

We need to modify the Cargo.toml file to include the rand crate as a dependency :
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.3.14"

Cargo checks the [dependencies] section and downloads any crates you don’t have yet.

Cargo.lock
    Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact
    every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the ver-
    sions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For
    example, what happens if next week version 0.3.15 of the rand crate comes
    out and contains an important bug fix but also contains a regression that
    will break your code?
    The answer to this problem is the Cargo.lock file, which was created the
    first time you ran cargo build and is now in your guessing_game directory.
    When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the ver-
    sions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the
    Cargo.lock file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see
    that the Cargo.lock file exists and use the versions specified there rather
    than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you have a
    reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will remain
    at 0.3.14 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the Cargo.lock file.
