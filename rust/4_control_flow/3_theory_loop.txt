Loops

    Rust has three kinds of Loops

        1. loop 
        2. while
        3. for

    loop

        The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

            loop {
                println!("you brokie !"); //give it a try 
            }

    while

            while condition {
                ...
            }

    for

        Take a look at this :
            
            let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
            let mut index = 0;
            while index < 5 {
                println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);
                index = index + 1;
            }

        This approach is error prone if the length is incorrect. 

            for element in a.iter() {
                println!("the value is: {}", element);
            }
        
        This is much safer. The safety and conciseness of for loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust.
        Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, For e.g.

            for countdown in (1..4).rev() {
                println!("{}", countdown);
            }
            println!("Liftoff !!");
