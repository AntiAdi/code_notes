if expression

    Syntax

        if condition 1 {
            ...
        }
        else if condition 2 {
            ...
        }
        ...
        ...
        else {
            ....
        }

    The condition MUST be a boolian.
        
        Condition cannot be something like this :

            let mut x : i32 = 1;
            if x {
                ...
            }
    
        This will throw an error. There is no implicit conversion.

    Using if in a let statement

        For example :

            let y = if condition 1 {
                4
            }
            else {
                5
            }

        Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions.
